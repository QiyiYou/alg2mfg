MATLAB code for "Preconditioning the augmented Lagrangian method for instationary mean field games with diffusion".

The path to `ppfem/lib/` should be made known to MATLAB using e.g. `addpath('./ppfem/lib/');`. 

For more info about `ppfem`, see [here](https://bitbucket.org/numpde/ppfem/).

Note that the [curvefit toolbox](https://mathworks.com/help/curvefit/) is required.

Run `main`.

Tested with R2016a (9.0.0.341360) 64-bit (glnxa64).
